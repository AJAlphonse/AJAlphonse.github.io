	<h1>What are UX design decisions that affect visually impaired users?</h1>
		<body>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>There has been a lot of research lately regarding the “inclusiveness” of the Internet. Considering nearly 52 million Americans suffer from some form of visual impairment, it only serves to benefit web designers to consider their needs when building a site.  Like any other structure in the corporeal world, the Internet should follow similar guidelines to ensure it is accessible by people of all physical and mental capacities.</p> 
			</p>Organizations such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) have been promoting accessible and inclusive web design since its conception in the 90’s. The RNIB says that if information is worth publishing on the web, it is worth ensuring that everyone can access it. In the past inclusive web design has been written off for a variety of reasons, but as advancements in technology surge, inclusive web design becomes easier and easier.</p>
			<p>A few simple options to ensure accessible web design are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><h6>Larger Text Options</h6>
	It can be seen on nearly every news gathering site, an option to increase body text size, and it has become something of a given amongst text-heavy sites. It is also crutial that articles and web pages be offered in “text-only” versions to avoid any difficulty reading in the sites original formation.</li>
					<li><h6>Increase in Contrast</h6>
	Users with visual impairments have a difficult time discerning information if it does not exist in high contrast. Using utilitarian typefaces, and coding to allow the highlighting of information is crucial.</li>
					<li><h6>Color Blindness</h6>
	Color blindness is amongst the most common visual impairments and is something that is often overlooked. Simple decisions such as separating green and red buttons can increase visual literacy significantly.</li>
					<li><h6>Keyboard Shortcuts and Tabbing</h6>
	Allowing users to tab through a site can significantly increase the usability for a user who cannot navigate a webpage successfully with vision alone. Most sites today will allow for some sort of tabbing functionality.</li>
				</ul>
